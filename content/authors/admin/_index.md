I am a PhD student at Inria Lille (team Scool, formerly SequeL) & CRIStAL (CNRS) under the supervision of [Philippe Preux](https://philippe-preux.github.io/) and [Odalric-Ambrym Maillard](http://odalricambrymmaillard.neowordpress.fr/), funded by the [B4H](https://www.inria.fr/en/philippe-preux-winner-ulne-i-sites-expand-call-projects) project.

My research focuses on reinforcement learning and stochastic bandits in risky, nonparametric environments. I am also working with François Pattou (PU-PH at CHU Lille and Inserm) and his team to design personalised, data-driven follow-up programmes after bariatric surgery for patients with obesity.
