summary: 'Easy to use and interpretable model based on artificial intelligence for predicting 5-year weight trajectories after bariatric surgery.'
abstract: "Weight loss (WL) after bariatric surgery (BS) varies with time, across patients and interventions. Realistic expectations of long term WL are crucial to inform clinical decisions by patients
and care providers. Our aim was to use arti�cial intelligence to develop an easy-to-use and
interpretable tool providing personalized estimation of 5-year postoperative weight trajectory.
Methods: We enrolled in this retrospective study the participants in 4 distinct BS cohorts with up to
5-year follow-up. A machine learning model was developed on cohort A (France, n=1,498 patients
submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or gastric band (GB)), and
further trained in cohort B (France, n=348, SG). The most predictive characteristics (> 1000 baseline
attributes) were selected using the LASSO algorithm to build interpretable regression trees predicting
WL up to 5 years after BS. Using root mean square error (RMSE), the resulting model was compared to
other models from the literature, and validated using external validation data from cohorts C (France,
n=237, SG-RYGB) and D (Netherlands, n=5,888, SG-RYGB-GB).
Results: The model outperformed other models from literature, while working across intervention
types and up to 5 years. It predicted postoperative WL with a RMSE of 3.3, 4.1 and 4.7 kg/m² in
validation data, at 1, 2 and 5 years respectively. This model highlighted the critical role of intervention,
age, and diabetes to predict long-term WL. As an example, in RYGB patients with diabetes duration <3
years, the mean predicted total WL was 33.2 % after 2 years, whereas the observed mean WL was
33.1% WL in the whole cohort A, and 32.0% in cohort D. Figure 1: online personalized estimate (IQR) of
5-year postoperative actual weight trajectory provided by the model.
Conclusion: We developed and validated an interpretable model predicting 5-year weight trajectories
after BS. A companion tool available online can be used at the point of care to inform clinical decisions
by patients and practitioners and optimize BS outcome."
