summary: 'Statistical decision making and applications to bariatric surgery.'
abstract: "We study some of the mathematical challenges that arise in the analysis of statistical sequential decision making algorithms for postoperative patients follow-up. Stochastic bandits model the learning of a sequence of actions (policy) by an agent in an uncertain environment in order to optimise observed rewards. To learn optimal policies, bandit algorithms have to balance exploitation of current knowledge and exploration of uncertain actions. Such algorithms have largely been studied and deployed in industrial applications with large datasets, low risk decisions and clear modelling assumptions, such as clickthrough rate maximisation in online advertising. By contrast, digital health recommendations face the challenges of small samples, risk-averse agents and complex, nonparametric modelling. We present new statistical methods, supported by formal performance guarantees, to adequately address these challenges. Furthermore, as a first step towards personalised postoperative follow-up recommendations, we also developed, in collaboration with surgeons, an interpretable machine learning model to predict the long-term weight trajectories of patients after bariatric surgery."
