summary: 'Easy-to-use AI calculator predicting 5y weight trajectories after bariatric surgery: a SOPHIA study (with [Pierre Bauvin](https://pierrebauvin.netlify.app/)).'
abstract: 'Background: Weight loss trajectories after bariatric surgery vary widely between individuals, while predicting weight loss before the operation remains challenging. We aimed to develop a model using artificial intelligence (AI) to provide individual preoperative prediction of the five-year weight loss trajectories after surgery.

Methods: We enrolled participants from ten prospective cohorts and two randomized trials in Europe, America, and Asia, with five-year follow-up after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or gastric band (GB). The development cohort comprised patients from two centers in France. The primary outcome was body mass index (BMI) at five years. A model was developed using LASSO to select variables and CART to build interpretable regression trees. The performances of the model were assessed through the median absolute deviation (MAD) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of BMI.

Findings: 10,231 patients were included, corresponding to 30,602 patient-years. Among the baseline attributes in the development cohort, seven variables were selected by LASSO: height, weight, intervention type, age, diabetes status, diabetes duration, and smoking status.
At five years, the overall mean values (95% CI) of MAD and RMSE of BMI across external validation cohorts were 2.8 (2.6; 3.0) kg/m2 and 4.7 (4.4; 5.0) kg/m2, respectively, while the mean (SD) difference between predicted and observed BMI at five years was -0.3 (4.7) kg/m2. The corresponding online companion tool can help inform clinical decisions before surgery (https://bariatric-weight-trajectory-prediction.univ-lille.fr/).

Interpretation: This AI-based calculator is easy to use and internationally validated, for predicting individual five-year weight loss trajectories after the three most common bariatric interventions.
